# Student Engagement Analysis: A Comprehensive Indicator Approach

This project aimed to create an indicator to identify active students on a forum. The indicator is based on four sub-indicators: average time spent on the platform, regularity of logins, number of responded messages, and number of shared files. A general indicator was also calculated considering all sub-indicators. The visualization of the indicator allows users to view either the general ranking or rankings based on individual sub-indicators, presented in a table or graphical format. The project provides a comprehensive tool for teachers to understand student engagement on the forum.
